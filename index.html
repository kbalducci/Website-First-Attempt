      <h1>Gluten, We Have a Problem.</h1>
      <p>Gluten is a common buzzword. It is popping up in the news, on food labels, in magazines, on the cover of best-selling books, at your child's school - seemingly everywhere except your Doctor's Office. So, how do you know if you have a problem with gluten?</p>
      <h2>The laundry list of possible gluten-related illnesses include:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>IBS</li>
          <li>Eczema</li>
          <li>Any Autoimmune Disease</li>
          <li>Hypothyroidism</li>
          <li>Asthma</li>
          <li>Osteoporosis</li>
          <li>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</li>
          <li>ADD/ADHD</li>
          <li>Bipolar</li>
          <li>Migraines or unexplained headaches</li>
          <li>Infertility or recurrent miscarriage</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>If any of these sound like you, gluten might be your problem.</h3>

      <p>To determine if gluten is not your friend you can get tested via blood, stool, urine or cheek swab or do an elimination diet. Okay, let's talk testing - if you bring this up with your primary care doctor they will probably give you a blood test for celiac antibodies. This could be helpful, if you in fact have celiac disease. However, many people with gluten issues do not have celiac. They might have non-celiac gluten sensitivity or intolerance.<br /></p>

      <p>So, what other tests are there? When I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance, I was seeing an Integrative Medicine Doctor who ordered Diagnos-Techs Expanded GI and Saliva panel. It did show that I had Gliadin Antibodies and therefore was intolerant to gluten. However, it is now known that people who react to gluten could react to various proteins, not just gliadin. I happened to react to gliadin so the test was positive. However, if I reacted to a different gluten protein the test would have been a false negative. If I were just starting out, I would recommend a more comprehensive test that tests for reactions to more antibodies or genetic testing.<br /></p>
