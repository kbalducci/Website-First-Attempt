      <h3>Now That I'm Gluten&#8208Free, What am I Supposed to Eat?</h3>
       <p>If you are simply gluten&#8208free then you will probably find lots of options at the grocery store and local restaurants. However, buyer beware &#8208 just because it&#39s gluten free does not mean it&#39s good for you. I follow a diet that is most closely connected to the paleo diet, but since I tolerate white rice nicely I include that in my diet. I also avoid many items that are on the avoid list with the autoimmune paleo protocol such as beans, nuts, legumes and a few other intolerances including chicken and most fish! So yes, my diet is pretty restrictive, but I still manage to eat out &#8208 so if I can find things, I&#39m sure you can as well.</p>

      <p>Use the table below as a starting point!</p>

      <table class='CenterTable'>
        <tr>
        <th>MEAT</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>When selecting meat, opt for grass&#8208fed, organic and antibiotic&#8208free when possible. Be careful with the prepared meats in the cases because they may have extra sauces or seasonings added to them which could mean gluten! For processed meats (bacon, sausage, hot dogs, lunch meat, etc), Applegate Farms is a brand with many gluten and dairy free options. Since meat alone does not have gluten, if it is not processed or marinated or seasoned in some way it should be gluten free. Meats have tons of healthy minerals, fats and proteins to help keep your nutrients up and to help you stay full.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>VEGETABLES</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Since going paleo I have increased my consumption of vegetables a ton. I never really liked most vegetables before, but when you are limited in what you can eat you will learn pretty quickly you need to add a variety of veggies. Also, they are great for vitamins and antioxidants. All fresh vegetables are gluten free. Be careful with processed, canned or pre&#8208made vegetables because of sauces and seasonings. I found out I love squash! &#8208 Zuchini, summer squash, spaghetti squash, acorn squash &#8208 try some to substitute for the grains that you will not be eating. One of my favorite tools is this vegetable spiralizer for making zuchinni noodles. Of course, leafy greens are a go to and make a great base for salads and green smoothies.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>FRUIT</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>All fresh fruits are naturally gluten free as well. Again, beware of prepared items or processed fruit. For some reason whenever humans are involved with foods before you get them at the grocery store they love to add gluten (usually in the form of some type of sauce, seasoning, preservative, etc). Also, with fruit &#8208 donâ€™t become a fruitaholic because it will throw your blood sugar out of whack. Just be reasonable. 3 servings a day should be good. Also, opt for lower glycemic fruits when possible (berries are great &#8208 high in antioxidants, low glycemic load).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>FATS AND OILS</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>
        Fat is good for you &#8208 see, don&#39t you love this diet already? Basically eat real, minimally processed fat &#8208 coconut oil, duck fat, tallow, bacon grease, butter (unless you are sensitive to dairy), olive oil, nut oils, avocado, etc. Avoid highly processed fats and oils such as canola oil, seed oils, soybean oil, corn oil, vegetable oil, man&#8208made butter substitutes.
