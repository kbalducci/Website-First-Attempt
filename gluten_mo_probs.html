      <h3>Gluten is Not Your ONLY Problem!</h3>

      <p>You've found out you&#39re gluten intolerant, sensitive, Celiac, etc: basically you and gluten are not friends. Now what?</p>

      <p>First, you must eliminate <em>100% of gluten, 100% of the time.</em> This is non-negotiable for your health. Gluten is the one restriction that you are not allowed any cheats. Cutting down on gluten does not work &#8208 it must be completely eliminated. Even a tiny amount of gluten can cause reactions for days, weeks, months…</p>

      <p>Once you know you have a gluten issue you have a choice and I hope you learn from my mistakes and choose the more direct route.</p>

      <p>So, when I found out I had non-Celiac gluten intolerance I eliminated gluten completely (of course there were a few times when I was “glutened” accidentally) but overall I knew I needed to eliminate gluten and I wanted to feel better so I did it. Cheating was not really an option for me b/c I found out pretty early when I was accidentally glutened that I would be rendered incapacitated if I dared to eat gluten. I&#39m talking 3 days in bed, intense joint and neck pain and a stomach pain that felt like I was being stabbed, not to mention a fever.  The reaction will vary by person, some people might not feel any negative side effects at the moment. However that doesn&#39t mean it&#39s not wreaking havoc on your body.</p>

      <p>Ok, so I eliminated all gluten. I spent a lot of time picking out gluten free cookies, crackers and chips and then looking over gluten free options at fast food restaurants and take&#8208out menus. Let&#39s face it, my diet was full of processed foods before gluten and that didn&#39t change when I found out about my gluten problem. However, I thought I was doing the right thing because I wasn&#39t eating gluten.  No surprise, I didn&#39t feel all that much better. I did feel a little better and started to really see the impact food can have on my body. I am so thankful that because I didn&#39t feel much, much better I didn&#39t go back to gluten. Some people do. They don&#39t feel better so they think gluten must not be their problem. Gluten is your problem. It&#39s just not your ONLY problem.</p>

      <p>I was not satisfied with feeling partially better. I wanted to feel back to my old self. I kept investigating. Hopefully you will skip living the 2 paragraphs preceding this and go directly to this step! After much research and working with a wonderful Chiropractic Neurologist I realized I had intestinal permeability and needed to heal my gut. So, I adopted an autoimmune paleo diet which meant that I avoided all grains, dairy, sugar, nuts, nightshades, eggs, caffeine and alcohol. The results were amazing. I felt functional again. The majority of my symptoms were gone within 30 days and I felt better than I ever had.</p>

      <p>Basically, this is where I would suggest anyone start if they find out they are gluten intolerant &#8208 follow a paleo diet and see how you feel. If you have any autoimmune issues (I have Hashimoto&#39s) then follow the autoimmune paleo diet. Remember, <strong>gluten is not your ONLY problem.</strong> You need to work on healing the gut by starting with diet.</p>


      <p>I do understand that going from SAD  (Standard American Diet) to autoimmune paleo is hard. Some people might need to do it in baby steps. If that’s what you need to do, start at going only gluten free &#8208 just don&#39t end there or stop because you don&#39t see all of the results you want. Continue onto grain free, then paleo, then autoimmune paleo if that&#39s what works for you. Just continue!</p>
